# Data object Observer

A small utility for transforming any data object into an Observable data object, through the use of a callback listener.

This functionality can be extended to load classes during the pre-main phase of a java program, or in a build phase through plugins like with gradle or maven.

The example shown here illustrates using this utility in standalone mode in a program.

## Example data class

This class is used in the application to shuttle data back and forth, and it is this data whose values a user may want to keep track of.

```java
public class Data {

    private String name;
    private boolean verified;

    public Data() {
    }

    public Data(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public boolean isVerified() {
        return verified;
    }

    public void setVerified(boolean verified) {
        this.verified = verified;
    }
}
```

## Example of Observable instance

This object is created by the user to receive data events whenever setters or getters in the data object of interest are accessed.

```java
Observable watch = new Observable() {

    @Override
    public void set(Object source, String field, Object oldValue, Object newValue) {
        System.out.printf("Setting value of property '%s' in class '%s' from %s to %s\n", field,
                source.getClass().getName(), oldValue, newValue);
    }

    @Override
    public void get(Object source, String field, Object value) {
        System.out.printf("getting value of property '%s' in class '%s' with value %s\n", field,
                source.getClass().getName(), value);
    }
}
```

## Example of transformation 

The transformation of a class into a participating Observable is done be passing the target class and Observer instance to the static __observe__ method of the __Reactive__ class.

```java
public class MakeObservable {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        generateRuntime();
    }

    public static void generateRuntime() throws IOException {
        List<Data> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            Data newData = Reactive.observe(Data.class, watch);
            newData.setName("Stephano_" + i);
            newData.setVerified(true);
            list.add(newData);
        }
        list.forEach(a -> System.out.printf("Is %s verified? %s", a.getName(), a.isVerified()));
    }
}
```

## Output generated by the example above

```bash
Setting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from null to Stephano_0
Setting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from false to true
Setting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from null to Stephano_1
Setting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from false to true
Setting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from null to Stephano_2
Setting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' from false to true
getting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value Stephano_0
getting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value true
Is Stephano_0 verified? truegetting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value Stephano_1
getting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value true
Is Stephano_1 verified? truegetting value of property 'name' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value Stephano_2
getting value of property 'verified' in class 'com.akilisha.reactive.Data0' with value true
Is Stephano_2 verified? true
```

## Summary 

This idea of the Observable utility can be extrapolated further and used for example, to generate data events, which would effectively create a data stream emanating from data changing in the observed instances.

The sky is truly the limit in what one can do!
